# project
My goal for this project is to make an injury risk assessment for every player in the NFL. Injuries play a huge part in football, which will reduce performance, make players lose playing time, and even shorten careers. Predicting and preventing injuries will be necessary to keep players as healthy as possible. The main goal of this project is to use historical data to make insights to reduce injury risks. To gather the information needed, I will need to find a data set online of every current NFL starterâ€™s injury history and proneness, and use this towards the insights made. Ideally, I would want to finish the coursera I found online about data analytics in python around early/mid-september and have the full project done while there is still some time left in the 2024 season, so maybe a little bit after Thanksgiving, in the first few weeks of December. I will definitely need an algorithm to clean data, and also definitely some machine learning algorithms. I will user test the software.
